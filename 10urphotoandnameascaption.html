        <h1> Dharani I</h1>
        <p>I am Dharani. I am from Thudiyalur. I completed my master of degree of computer science in 2021 with 84.2%. 
            Then I worked for one year as an admin staff(IEC coordinator) at Aravind Eye Hospital, Pondicherry. 
            I like to play tennis and do some gardening work in my free time. I am a quick learner and 
            can work as a team and I can adapt to any environment easily. I like coding. My passion is to become a coder.
            I have done my project in PG named "Human Resource Management" using HTML, CSS, PHP and MYSQL.
            It made me beleive that I have some coding knowledge and I can also able to do it. So, I choose this path as my Career.
